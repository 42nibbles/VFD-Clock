  "rst cause: 4" steht für WDT reset 
  ** Quelle: https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/issues/1013
     siehe "h4rm0n1c"

     reset causes:
        0:
        1: normal boot
        2: reset pin
        3: software reset
        4: watchdog reset

* Analyse ab Zeile 552
  - Durch main.cpp, setSyncProvider(&timeProvider); scheinen alle 301 Sekunden
    Zeitsynchronisationen durchgeführt zu werden.
  - D.h. nach "@1564136368 UTC" wäre der nächste Sync um 1564136669 fällig
    gewesen.
  - Anscheinend hat der NTP-Zugriff nicht geklappt, weshalb um @1564136675 UTC,
    also 6 Sekunden später, der vorgesehende RTC-Sync durchgeführt wurde.
  - "Exception (29)" steht nach "doc/xtensa-isa.pdf", Table 4–64, für
    "StoreProhibitedCause" also eine Speicherschutzverletzung.
  - In Zeile 556 steht "epc1=0x40223b6f"; durch den Aufruf von
    "~/.platformio/packages/toolchain-xtensa/bin/xtensa-lx106-elf-objdump -d \
    /home/hoffmann/git/vfd-clock/.pio/build/esp01_1m/firmware.elf | less"
    konnte für die Adresse 0x40223b6f, die Anweisung "s8i a4, a2, 1" ermittelt
    werden, also eine "8-bit store"-Anweisung, siehe genanntes PDF, Seite 504.
    Die ausgeführte Funktion war dabei <ieee80211_add_xrates>, also eine
    WiFi-Funktion. Die Quelladresse steht im $a4, die Zieladresse ergibt
    sich aus "$a2+1". Die Werte von $a2 und $a4 sind mir nicht bekannt.
  - Nach "4.4.1.6" könnte der Wert "excvaddr=0x00000019" die Adresse sein,
    bei der durch s8i die Exception ausgelöst wurde.
  - In 19,5h stürzte die Uhr 8-mal ab, vermutlich durch Probleme im
    gegenwärtigen WiFi-System.
  - Die ieee80211_add_xrates-Funktion ist für espressif8266 in der Library
    libnet80211.a zu finden, siehe
    "find ~/.platformio -type f -exec grep ieee80211_add_xrates {} /dev/null \;"
  - Die Tools-Versionen von NONOSDK221, NONOSDK22x und NONOSDK3V0 scheinen
    gemäß der version Datei v2.1.0-10-g509eae8, v2.2.1-61-gc7b580c und
    v2.2.0-28-g89920dc zu sein.
  - In "~/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoespressif8266/libraries/ESP8266WiFi/src"
    lies sich nicht einmal eine Datei finden, deren eigentlicher Quellcode "rates"
    enthielt: Befehl war "find . -type f -exec grep rates {} /dev/null \;".
